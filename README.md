PHP practice project from the PHP with MySQL Essential Training video found on Lynda. My progress as I follow along with the video in making a simple content management system using a wamp server.

Form Processing,
Database Integration,
Tracking Sessions and Cookies,
Using GET/POST Values,
Performing SQL CRUD,
Managing user Login/Logout,
and basics such as Functions, Data Types, Loops, etc.
